# Impact-of-Bison-reintroduction-in-Siberia
What is the optimal density of American bison to reintroduce in Siberia to slow down the thawing of the permafrost by trampling the snow ? 

The assignment was to find an application to create and use differential equations and define a relationship between a physical quantity (the functions, here the density of bisons to reintroduce) and their rates of change (the derivatives, here the thawing of the permafrost).

You can change the density of bisons by changing the value of B.
You can also reduce the value of kAS to allow it to not melt as fast.

I made this project with 2 of my classmates.
