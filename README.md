# Impact-of-Bison-reintroduction-in-Siberia
What is the optimal density of American bison to reintroduce in Siberia to slow down the thawing of the permafrost by trampling the snow ? 

You can change the density of bisons by changing the value of B.
You can also reduce the value of kAS to allow it to not melt as fast.

I made this project with 2 of my classmates.
